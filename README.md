# pug-tutorial
Following Antonio Regadas on the Pug tutorial located at https://codeburst.io/getting-started-with-pug-template-engine-e49cfa291e33

The tutorial does not mention that the Pug-CLI has been split off from the main implementation.  So you need to:
`npm install -g pug-cli`

This supplements the material in the moz-express-tut repo, specifically: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Displaying_data/Template_primer
